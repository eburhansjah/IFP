# IFP (Image Filtering Project)
## Overview
The goal of the project was to build a user-friendly android app that modifies uploaded images. Images can be in the form of .png files or .text files. 

The app displays the image/modified image on the screen.

## Features of the app in action

Note: text file must be formatted particularly like the following in order to be converted into an image:

### II. Zero GB
Zero GB is a feature that recolors the uploaded image by zero-ing out all green and blue components of pixels. As a result, the modified image will have different shades of red, ranging from black (if the red component was originally zero) to full red (if the red component was at its maximum value).
